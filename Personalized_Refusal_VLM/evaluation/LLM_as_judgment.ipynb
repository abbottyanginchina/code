As a result, the art of the Renaissance period was marked by a blend of classical and humanist themes, as well as a focus on realism, naturalism, and the human form. The artists of this period, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, made significant contributions to the development of Western art and continue to be celebrated for their innovative and influential works.\n"
